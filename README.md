# My Text Adventure

Just doing this for fun. Seeing where it goes...Does anyone play these anymore, anyway?

## Install

- Clone this repository.
- cd into folder
- run: 

```shell
$ go build game.go
```
- Then just execute!

```shell
$ ./game
```

## Things to do.

- Intro
- Add the rope item
- Continue work on area descriptions
- Need to come up with a mini game for fighting the monster...skill, or luck?
- Add inventory to an area. So if you pick up the axe in one area and drop it in another, it is in that area.
